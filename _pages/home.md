  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  1.	Investigate the Complex Interplay Between Hormones, the Immune System, and Clinical Outcomes
  - Focus on understanding how hormonal factors influence disease progression and treatment responses in women with neuroimmunological diseases.
  - Recent work examples: <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200106?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">fertility treatments</a>
  - <strong>Utilize Neuroimaging, Biomarkers for Improved Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring</strong>
    - Leverage advanced neuroimaging techniques and biosample collection to identify biomarkers that predict disease progression and treatment efficacy.
    - Recent work examples: <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000000959?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">here</a> and <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000000890?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">here</a>
    - Collaborate on industry-sponsored studies to enhance the quality and breadth of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
  
  2. Foster Collaborative Research to Accelerate Discoveries in Neuroimmunology and Women's Health, with a focus on treatments
  - Build a sustainable, adaptable network that facilitates collaboration across institutions, countries, and sectors to drive innovative research in neuroimmunology.
  - Focus on reproductive safety of medications and interventions

  <h3>Background</h3>
  Over the past decade, our network has engaged in numerous joint collaborations and projects, uniting researchers, clinicians, and industry partners in the pursuit of advancing women’s health within the field of neuroimmunology. This extensive history of collaboration has produced impactful publications, driven new insights into disease mechanisms, and fostered a supportive, dynamic research community.
  
  This initiative represents a formalization of that collective work, aiming to streamline collaborative efforts, reduce individual administrative burdens, and provide a flexible framework for expanding our network. By organizing and consolidating resources and expertise, we aspire to enhance the quality and reach of our research in neuroimmunological diseases.
  
  Additionally, we seek to broaden our community by welcoming new researchers and fostering the inclusion of diverse perspectives. A key goal is to encourage young investigators to enter the field, providing mentorship and collaboration opportunities to cultivate the next generation of leaders in neuroimmunology and women’s health research.
